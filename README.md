# Spark in Action, 2nd edition – Java, Python, and Scala code for chapter 17

Chapter 17 is about exporting data.

This code is designed to work with Apache Spark v2.4.4.

## Labs

### Lab \#100
Adapted from one of IBM's [Code for Call starter kit](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/starters/water), but leveraging the [wildfires category](https://developer.ibm.com/code-and-response/disasters/wildfires).

### Lab \#200
Feeds data into Delta Lake.

### Lab \#210, \#220
Run analytics on dta stored in Delta Lake.

### Lab \#250
Feeds data into Delta Lake.

### Lab \#900
Append using primary key.

## Datasets

Dataset(s) used in this chapter:

 * https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/donnees-ouvertes-du-grand-debat-national/#_
 * Populations légales 2016 https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/3677785?sommaire=3677855

## Notes

 1. Due to renaming the packages to match more closely Java standards, this project is not in sync with the book's MEAP prior to v10 (published in April 2019).
 2. As of MEAP v14, we have introduced Scala and Python examples (published in October 2019). All examples are in Java. Examples in Python and Scala are coming.
